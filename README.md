sonicScrewdriver
================

A plotting tool for high-energy physics using Root


Goal
----

The Sonic Screwdriver is designed to generate high-energy physics plots easily by providing the user with a clean, flexible front-end aimed to manipulate physics concepts instead of ROOT-related technical mess.


Features
--------

- Add variables, process classes, regions and channels
- Create the histograms that will be needed for your plots in one line
- List the type of plots you want to be produced
- Add options where you want to change the standard behavior
- Run over your events and fill all the histograms in one line
- Ask for the plots to be produced
- Run your macro, browse your plots and do actual physics
